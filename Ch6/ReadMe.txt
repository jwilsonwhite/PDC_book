deValpine_sims.R creates Fig 6.5. (note that unlike most other code in this book, this is in R not Matlab because it uses code originally written by Perry de Valpine and published in the SI for his 2009 paper in Ecology. Details here: http://www.esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/205/suppl-1.htm)

(Fig. 6.7 was created in Adobe Illustrator)
